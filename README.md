# Wordpress Starter theme with SASS

This is an instruction and folder structure to setup a boilerplate for developing a website with wordpress and sass. This folder structure is valid only while using [underscores.me](http://underscores.me/) generated theme.

## Steps to install and setup

1. Download the underscores theme with sassify option (advanced view) from [underscores.me](http://underscores.me/). 
Extract the downloaded folder to "mytheme" folder.

2. Move the "sass" folder to "src" folder which is one level above.

3. Inside the "sass" folder, create a new folder called "vendors". Go inside the '/vendors' folder and run the following commands.

If you are not installed [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) in your computer before, do the following

```bash
gem install bourbon
gem install neat
bourbon install
neat install
```

If you have already installed [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) and [neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) in your computer.

```bash
bourbon install
neat install
```

4. Change "mytheme" folder name to whichever name you would prefer. If you do so, please change the destination path in the Gruntfile.js appropriately.

5. Open "package.json" file and change the name and description.

6. Run the command "npm install", this will download all the required node modules to the root.

## Deploy

It is quite simple to deploy all the compiled files to your wordpress theme folder. Just copy the "mytheme" folder to your wordpress "theme" directory.
